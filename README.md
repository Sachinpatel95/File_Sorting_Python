# File-Sorting-With-GUI-in-Python
Generally our download folder is a super big mixure of some documents, audios, videos etc. So, I developed a software to categorized in folders (Like, audio files will automatically moved to a new folder named "audio", same like document files, video files, image files and others).


	You have no need to pre install app or something. It is like plug and play.
